## Financial Philosophy
I adhere to the Financial Order of Operations, created by Brian Preston and Bo Hanson of The Money Guy Show. This philosophy underpins the structure and recommendations found within the templates and guides in this repository.

The Financial Order of Operations provides a step-by-step roadmap to help individuals prioritize their financial decisions and optimize their financial health. This framework ensures that you tackle your financial goals in the most efficient and effective order. Below is a comprehensive overview of each step in the Financial Order of Operations.

* **Step 1: Deductibles Covered**
Before anything else, ensure you have a small emergency fund in place. This fund should be enough to cover your insurance deductibles or unexpected expenses, typically around $1,000 to $2,000. This initial safety net prevents you from falling into debt when unexpected costs arise.

* **Step 2: Employer Match**
If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and one of the best returns on investment you can get. Make sure you are taking full advantage of this benefit before moving on to other financial goals.

* **Step 3: High-Interest Debt**
Pay off any high-interest debt, such as credit card balances. High-interest debt can quickly become a financial burden due to the compounding interest, so it's crucial to eliminate it as soon as possible. Aim to pay off debts with interest rates above 6-8%.

* **Step 4: Emergency Reserves**
Expand your initial emergency fund to cover 3 to 6 months of living expenses. This more substantial emergency fund provides a financial cushion in case of job loss, medical emergencies, or other significant life events.

* **Step 5: Roth & HSA**
Contribute to a Roth IRA and HSA up to the maximum limit. A Roth IRA allows your investments to grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free. This can be a powerful tool for long-term wealth building.

If you have access to a Health Savings Account (HSA), contribute to it. HSAs offer triple tax advantages: contributions are tax-deductible, investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free. Maxing out your HSA can be a strategic move for both healthcare costs and retirement savings.

* **Step 6: Max-Out Retirement**
Return to your 401(k) and contribute up to the maximum limit. After securing the employer match earlier, now is the time to fully fund your 401(k) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth and compounding interest.

* **Step 7: Hyper-Accumulation**
Focus on hyper-accumulation by investing any additional funds. This can include taxable brokerage accounts, real estate investments, or other investment opportunities. The goal is to grow your wealth significantly over time.

* **Step 8: Prepaid Future Expenses**
Consider prepaying future major expenses, such as a wedding, a new car, a child's educational expenses, or home renovations. By planning and saving for these expenses ahead of time, you avoid taking on debt when the time comes to make these purchases.

* **Step 9: Low-Interest Debt**
Address any remaining low-interest debt, such as student loans or mortgages. While these debts typically have lower interest rates, paying them off can still free up cash flow and reduce your financial obligations.
